## Description
This project performs scalable, distributed analysis on the **LargeST dataset** (8,600+ sensors, 2017–2021) using **Apache Spark**. Instead of deep neural forecasting, the analysis focuses on identifying spatio-temporal congestion patterns, examining graph structures within the road network, and implementing **Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** for efficient similarity search across massive traffic logs.
